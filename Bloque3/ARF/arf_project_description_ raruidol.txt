Title: MINSAIT REAL ESTATE MODELLING

Description: On this work I have created a model to predict time spent on real state website. From a relatively huge amount of data extracted from a real state website, a predictive model has been implemented. In this work I will show a comparative between different techniques and the relevance of feature representation in order to obtain good results. This work has been done inside the context of the Cajamar datathon competition where a challenge is proposed and participants must find the best performing configuration from the given data.

Objectives:
- Introduce this domain
- Explain the feature extraction and representation process
- Compare different machine learning approaches
- Explain the most important concepts of gradient tree boosting (best performing approach)
- Conclude with the results obtained

Subset: (work already done since the competition was held in February).
